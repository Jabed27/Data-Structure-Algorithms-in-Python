# Data-Structure-Algorithms-in-Python
This repository will have many algorithm implementation in python , simulation and some python templates.

# Rules:

1) Anyone can provide any algorithm or data structure implementation.If you wanna provide a implementation,then create another branch and commit in that branch.
branch name should be the name of area of implementation and  the commit message should be the program name.For example-
If  you wanna contribute a implementation Prims algorithm then branch name should be algorithm or graph algorithm. And the commit message should be the name of programs you are providing.

2) If you want a implementation or any kind help or any questions then you can write that in the issue section.

3) You can give suggestion in issue section to make the repository better.

4) Don't add any solution of Problems in the repository only algorithm/data sructure implementation will be accepted.
You can provide program templates.Such as-  Removing duplicates from a list or Counting frequency of numbers in list. 
Any modified template of algorithms will also be allowed. Such as - Finding Shortest Path using BFS/DFS , Find the node that is unreachable from the source using Dijkstra/BFS/DFS etc . So this kind of implementation will be allowed.
